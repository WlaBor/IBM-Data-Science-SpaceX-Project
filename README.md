# IBM-Data-Science-SpaceX-Project
This repository is a hands-on subtest of IBM's Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone course. The goal of this project is to make a prediction about the Falcon 9 rocket landing.

SpaceX advertises a cost of $62 million on its website for Falcon 9 rocket launches, other providers cost up to $165 million each, with much of the savings coming from the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage. So if we can determine whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if another company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### Skills Required:
Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Sklearn, Requests.
